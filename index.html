          <p> Salmon runs in our Territory start mid to late August and last until mid to late December.</p>
          <p> Preserving is essential to ensure that the salmon does not lose their essential oils.</p>
          <p> Due to the rainy weather we have in our territory wind drying can take too long.</p>
          <p> Smoking salmon is the preffered way, combined with preserving in jars help keep them through the winter.</p>

            <p> Sockeye Salmon have two runs, the first run have a Red flesh, the second run have a lighter pink flesh</p>
          `<p> Coho Salmon have a red flesh in the earlier part of the run but lose colour in the later part.</p>
            <p> Chum or Dog Salmon flesh are mostly white, and these are preserved to keep house pets fed through the winter</p>
          <p> Chinook or Zumack Salmon early run have red or bright pink flesh and is high in oil and can take 7 to 9 days to smoke through.</p>

    <p> Smoking salmon is the preferred way to preserve in our territory </p>
    <p> The different types of Salmon have different ways of preserviing</p>
    <p> Sockeye can be prepared by filleting the backbone out and spreading it open to be hung in the smoke shack or cooked beside an open fire</p>
    <p> Coho is best prepared filleted and layed flat on a rack</p>
    <p> Chum and Chinook are prepared the same way as Coho due to high oil content</p>
    <p> Smoking adds flavor and keeps the essential oils in the salmon well into winter</p>
    <p> Additional layer of preservation of Smoked Salmon can be done in jars and a pressure cooker</p>

      <p> The process of preparing the salmon for storage takes an average of 7 to 10 days</p>
      <p> The smoked salmon are then put in brown paper wrapping to cure for an additional 2 days </p>
      <p> Once curing is done the smoked salmon are stored in two ways, sealed in wrap, and preserved further in jars using a pressure cooker</p>
